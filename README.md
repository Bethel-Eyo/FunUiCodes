# FunUiCodes
 This application implements Major design features, managing gestures, animation transitions for mobile applications using react native, it also uses redux to store data and pass it down to the different inner components of the app. it also includes the following features
 
1. Firebase Authentication
2. Reading data from APIs
3. Persisting data
4. Asyncstorage and Redux,
5. Advanced Gestures and lots more...

I would love to appreciate designcode.io for helping me understand how to use all these different features in developing a full fleshed react-native app. screenshots and gifs will be coming in soon...
